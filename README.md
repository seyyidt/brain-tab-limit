## ✨ What It Does

Brain Tab Limit enforces a hard cap of **7 open tabs** in your browser.  
No settings. No options. Just focus.

When tab number 8 opens, it’s instantly closed—helping you stay within your cognitive limits.

## 🧪 Why 7?

> "The magical number seven, plus or minus two..."  
> — George A. Miller, 1956

Scientific studies on **working memory** show that humans can effectively process **about 7** pieces of information at once.  
More than that causes stress, distraction, and degraded decision-making.

📊 **7 tabs = Max clarity.**
